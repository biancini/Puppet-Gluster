Puppet modules to install and configure GlusterFS on linux
==========================================================

This project contains pupped modules for different pieces of software, in particular
it is intended to provide the required installation steps for GlusterFS.

This project started from the modules from puppetlabs and patched and modified some
of them to correct problems in GlusterFS installation.

The module has been developed and tested on Debian linux systems.
